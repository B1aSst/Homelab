My homelab is a project that started with a simple NAS in 2023 during my first internship as a sysadmin.
When I talked to my colleague, they all said that they had some server to test things so thats when it started for me.

My only goal with this HomeLab is to be able to try things however I want and to learn. As my main topic of interest is network security, I'm very happy I started this HomeLab.

I tried to buy hardware with a minimalist approach, I don't wanted things too noisy or too big. It had to fit in a bookshelves and be in a living room.

## Hardware

- Fortigate 60E (Firewall)
- Cisco SG300-10 (Switch L2)
- Synology DS223 (NAS)
- Minisforum NAB5 (Mini server)
- Ubiquiti UniFi UAP-nanoHD (Wi-Fi Access Point)
- APC Back-UPS (Battery backup & Surge protector)

### Why and usage

I started with the Synology NAS, today I think it was a mistake but I had to start somewhere. I think it was too expensive and today I only use it purely as a NAS but it can be used as a home server as it support Docker and has a lot of app built-in.

I got the Fortigate from a second-hand site, It's a great appliance and nice to have because I use them at work and so I can practice with it.

I also got the switch from second hand, I did a lot of Cisco during my first three year of study and I knew that it was a lot used in enterprise environnemnt so that's why I choose it.

I bought the NAB5 mini pc because I simply wanted something powerfull and not too noisy.

I got the AP from second hand and it's working fine so far. The Ubiquiti UI is very great and the AP can be fully configured. I used it to

I bought the UPS because there is power cut sometimes so my lab doesn't go offline.
